JsHamcrest --- Library of matcher objects for JavaScript
========================================================

JsHamcrest is a JavaScript library heavily inspired by `Hamcrest`_. It provides
a *large* library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates)
allowing "match" rules to be defined declaratively. Typical scenarios include
testing frameworks, mocking libraries, UI validation rules and object querying.

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of The
`BSD License`_ and sponsored by `Destaquenet Technology Solutions`_, a
brazilian software development and consultancy startup.
