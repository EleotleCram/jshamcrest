JsHamcrest
----------

    http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/tree/master


JsHamcrest is a JavaScript port of Hamcrest, which provides a library of
matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing 'match'
rules to be defined declaratively. JsHamcrest integrates out of the box
with JsTestDriver, JsUnitTest, QUnit and YUITest (and there's more to come!).

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of the Lesser General
Public License v3.0 and sponsored by Destaquenet Technology Solutions, a
brazilian software development and consultancy startup.


Downloading
-----------

Visit the following URL to download the latest stable version of JsHamcrest
and its API documentation:

    http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/downloads


Installation
------------

In order to use JsHamcrest with a supported JavaScript unit test framework,
just follow the usual installation/configuration instructions of the chosen
framework and plug JsHamcrest to it. Configuration instructions for each
supported framework can be found in the API documentation
(JsHamcrest.Integration namespace).


Usage
-----

Here goes a list containing a subset of all available assertion matchers.
Please read the API documentation to see all matchers and instructions on how
to use them:

- Core matchers:
    assertThat(10, is(equalTo(10)), "10 == 10");
    assertThat(10, not(equalTo(20)), "10 != 20");
    assertThat(myObj, anything(), "myObj should by anything, we don't care");
    assertThat(myObj, nil(), "myObj == null");
    assertThat(myObject, sameAs(anotherObj), "myObject === anotherObject");
    assertThat(myFunction, raises('MyException'), "myFunction should raise an exception");
    assertThat(10, both(greaterThan(5)).and(lessThan(20)), "10 > 5 && 10 < 20");
    assertThat(10, either(lessThan(20)).or(greaterThan(50)), "10 < 20 || 10 > 50");

- Numbers:
    assertThat(10, greaterThan(5), "10 > 5");
    assertThat(10, greaterThanOrEqualTo(5), "10 >= 5");
    assertThat(5, lessThan(10), "5 < 10");
    assertThat(5, lessThanOrEqualTo(10), "5 <= 10");
    assertThat(Math.sqrt(-1), notANumber(), "isNaN(Math.sqrt(-1))");
    assertThat(5, between(4).and(7), "5 >= 4 && 5 <= 7");

- Text:
    assertThat('str', equalIgnoringCase('Str'), "Compare 'str' and 'Str' ignoring case");
    assertThat('string', containsString('tri'), "'tri' should be a substring of 'string'");
    assertThat('string', startsWith('str'), "'string' should start with 'str'");
    assertThat('string', endsWith('ring'), "'string' should end with 'ring'");
    assertThat('0xa4f2c', matches(/\b0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+\b/), "String should match an hexadecimal number");

- Object:
    assertThat(myObj, hasMember('name'), "myObj have a property/function called 'name'");
    assertThat(myObj, instanceOf(Array), "myObj instanceof Array");

- Collection:
    assertThat([1,2,3], hasItems(2, 3), "Array should have items == 2 and 3");
    assertThat([1,2,3], hasItems(greaterThan(2)), "Array should have at least one item > 2");
    assertThat([1,2,3], hasSize(lessThan(5)), "Array size should be < 5");


Building
--------

If you want to build JsHamcrest yourself, you have to install Apache Ant in
your machine if you don't have it already. Visit the following URL to
download Ant and get further instructions on how to install it in your system:

    http://ant.apache.org/

After that, execute the following command line to perform the complete build:

    $ ant build
