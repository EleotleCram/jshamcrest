JsUnitTest-Hamcrest is a port of Hamcrest to JsUnitTest. Hamcrest provides a
library of matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing
'match' rules to be defined declaratively. JsUnitTest provides a one-file
JavaScript test suite.

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of the Lesser General
Public License v3.0 and sponsored by Destaquenet Technology Solutions, a
brazilian software development and consultancy startup.


Usage
-----

In order to use JsUnitTest-Hamcrest, you have to download and import the
JsUnitTest script in your HTML page:

<script src="jsunittest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jsunittest-hamcrest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

That's it, now (almost) all the Hamcrest goodies are available to your
JsUnitTest Testcase, for example:

    new Test.Unit.Runner({
        setup: function() {
            this.calc = new MyCalculator();
        },

        teardown: function() {
        },

        testAdd: function() { with(this) {
            var result = this.calc.add(2, 3);
            assertThat(result, is(equalTo(5)));
        }},
        
        testSub: function() { with(this) {
            var result = this.calc.sub(2, 3);
            assertThat(result, is(lessThanOrEqualTo(0)));
        }},
        
        // use your imagination!
        // ...
        
    }, {'testLog':'myLog'});

Very easy, isn't it?
