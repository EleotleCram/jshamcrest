JsHamcrest
----------

    http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/tree/master


JsHamcrest is a JavaScript port of Hamcrest, which provides a library of
matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing 'match'
rules to be defined declaratively. JsHamcrest integrates out of the box
with JsTestDriver, JsUnitTest, QUnit and YUITest (and there's more to come!).

This is an open source project licenced under the terms of the Lesser General
Public License v3.0 and sponsored by Destaquenet Technology Solutions, a
brazilian software development and consultancy startup.
