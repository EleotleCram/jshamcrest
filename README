JsHamcrest
----------

    http://github.com/danielfm/jshamcrest/tree/master


JsHamcrest is a JavaScript port of Hamcrest, which provides a library of
matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing 'match'
rules to be defined declaratively. JsHamcrest integrates out of the box
with JsUnitTest and YUITest (more to come).

Usage
-----

In order to use JsHamcrest, you have to chooose a supported JavaScript unit
test framework. For example, to use it with JsUnitTest, download and import
JsUnitTest scripts in your HTML page:

    <!-- JsUnitTest -->
    <script src="jsunittest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
    <!-- Don't forget to activate JsUnitTest integration -->
    <script src="jshamcrest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        JsHamcrest.Integration.JsUnitTest();
    </script>


That's it! Here goes a simple usage example:

    new Test.Unit.Runner({
        setup: function() {
            this.calc = new MyCalculator();
        },

        teardown: function() {
        },

        testAdd: function() { with(this) {
            var result = this.calc.add(2, 3);
            assertThat(result, equalTo(5));
        }},
        
        testSub: function() { with(this) {
            var result = this.calc.sub(2, 3);
            assertThat(result, equalTo(-1));
        }}
    }, {'testLog':'myLog'});


If you want to use YUITest instead JsUnitTest, the procedure is almost the
same:

    <!-- YUITest and dependencies -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/yuilogger/logger.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/yuitest/yuitest.js"></script>

    <!-- Don't forget to activate YUITest integration -->
    <script src="jshamcrest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        JsHamcrest.Integration.YUITest();
    </script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        CalculatorTestCase = new YAHOO.tool.TestCase({
            name: "Calculator test case",

            setup: function() {
                this.calc = new MyCalculator();
            },

            teardown: function() {
            },

            testAdd: function() { with(this) {
                var result = this.calc.add(2, 3);
                Assert.that(result, equalTo(5));

                // In YUITest, the assertion method is Assert.that(), not assertThat()!
                // JsHamcrest tries not to screw with the conventions adopted by the
                // unit test framework being used, making the integration look less
                // intrusive and more natural
            }},
            
            testSub: function() { with(this) {
                var result = this.calc.sub(2, 3);
                Assert.that(result, equalTo(-1));
            }}
        });
    </script>


Building
--------

If you want to build JsHamcrest yourself, you have to install Apache Ant in
your machine if you don't have it already. Visit the following URL to
download Ant and get further instructions on how to install it in your system:

    http://ant.apache.org/

After that, execute the following command line to perform the complete build:

    $ ant all

Doing this, the .js files built will be available inside the 'build' directory.
The API documentation will be available inside the 'doc/api' directory.
